# Akan names
This project was about using the knowledge that we acquired during the past week on javascript to create a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture, where by the Ghanian people used to give their children that first names depending on the day they were born.
